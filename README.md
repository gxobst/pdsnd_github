### Explore Bike Share Data with R
This is a repository for my Udacity Nano Degree program: Programming for Data Science with R.

### Project Description
In this project, the bike share data are explored with the help of R language. Three main questions have been raised and explored with codes and plots.
Question 1: What are the counts of each user type in different cities?
Question 2: What is the average travel time for each user type in different cities?
Question 3: What is the distribution of birth years of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)?

### Files used
Files used are 3 csv files, namely bike share data in Washington, NYC and Chicago.

### Credits

Tools used are R, RStudio, Atom, Git Bash, GitHub
Special thanks to Udacity, who has made all this possible for me and enriched my knowledge in Programming!
